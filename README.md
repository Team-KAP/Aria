# NetWeaver

NetWeaver is an artificial neural network visualization tool that automatically generates code on-the-fly as users design their own networks. Users are able to add and remove layers, fine-tune more advanced hyperparameters, and modify aspects of the training process. While they configure the network to their liking, the page generates in real-time the code for the TensorFlow Keras library that will create that exact network.
